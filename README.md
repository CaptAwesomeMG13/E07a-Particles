# E07a-Particles
Playing with particles and emitters

This project is based around particle effects. I created mine based around the smoke particle
effect. I have changed the color of the through open colors to a gray to reflect the normal
color smoke has and then changed the duration of the effect to last even longer like the 
smoke is slowly disapating to create a spooky effect. This project is pretty straight 
forward and no other changes were made to the initial class itself. It was meant as a
project to learn about how to control particle effects and see how they run and work in 
a class.
